# Regex Tutorial

Regex, which is short for regular expression, is a sequence of characters that defines a specific search patter. In this assignment I will be explaining what regex is by defining the individual parts of regex.

## Summary

In the tutorial, I will be explaning features of regex in a way that is understandible.

## Regex Components

### Anchors
 Anchors are there for you to be able to define the search from the start or the end.

 In this case, /^ and $/ signify the beginning or end of the expression:

* The ^ matches the beginning of the string, or the beginning of a line if the multiline flag or (m) is enabled. This matches a position, not a character.
* The $ matches the end of the string, or the end of a line if the multiline flag (m) is enabled. This matches a position, not a character.
### Quantifiers
Quantifiers are there to tell you how many times a part of your expression should be repeated.
### OR Operator
|| is known as OR operator. The || acts like a boolean OR and it matches the expression before or after the ||. It can operate within a group, or on a whole expression. The patterns will be tested in order. It checks whether any of the two operands are non-zero (0, false, undefined, null or “” is considered as zero).
